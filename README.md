## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

### Scripts Placement -- Server side vs Client side 

**Server Side:**
Scripts that are in the top fontmatter part of the page are used for static content and are run at build time. These do not need to be wrapped in a script tag

**Client Side for interactivity**
Using a script tag at the bottom of the page is where you import scripts that are run client side by the browser to add client side interactivity. Sent to the browser when written or imported in between script tags

### Slotting child content inside components
Use the <slot /> tag to inject content into a layout component
